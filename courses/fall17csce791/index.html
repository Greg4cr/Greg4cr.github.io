<li><strong>August 25, 2017 - Geometric Approaches to Derandomizing Parallel Matching and Matroid Algorithms</strong><br>
<ul><li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Stephen Fenner, University of South Carolina<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> I will describe a cluster of recent results that help to derandomize some parallel algorithms for graphs and matroids. Specifically, it has been shown that the problem of finding a perfect matching in a graph is in the complexity class quasi-NC, that is, it is solvable in polylogarithmic time (that is, logO(1)n time) time using quasipolynomially many processors (that is, 2logO(1) n many processors). This was first shown for bipartite graphs by F, Gurjar, and Thierauf in 2015, and a proof for general graphs was announced last spring by Svensson and Tarnawski (to appear in FOCS 2017). In the interim, Gurjar and Thierauf (2016) gave a quasi-NC algorithm for the Linear Matroid Intersection problem. All these results use similar techniques that are based in geometry---for example, discovering lower dimensional faces of the perfect matching polytope of a graph. I will emphasize these geometrical techniques in the talk.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>September 1, 2017 - An Application of Natural Language Processing: Analyzing student essays as a big-data project</strong><br>
<ul><li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Duncan Buell, University of South Carolina<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> First year students at most large universities take required courses whose purpose is to teach them to write prose essays and make arguments. We have acquired more than 7000 pairs of draft-and-final essays from USC and have been analyzing them. We are not trying to do “machine grading” of essays as an AI project. Rather, we are trying to identify features of writing that can be quantified and thus processed with programs as a big-data analysis. We are interested in the extent to which students revise their draft essays to become final versions. And we are interested in comparing our student writing against other genres of writing. For this last we use the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) as source data. The COCA is a corpus of more than 500 million words of text separated into genres of academic writing, magazine writing, transcripts of spoken English and interviews, and such. Our eventual goal is to situate student writing relative to other genres and thus to help with improving the pedagogy of teaching writing; knowing what the students are actually writing now is key to knowing how to get them to write formal prose effectively.  Programming is done in Python. Part of speech tagging is done using the CLAWS package from the University of Lancaster in the UK. Sentence parsing is done using the package from Dan Jurafsky’s lab at Stanford.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Bio:</strong> Duncan A. Buell is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Unviversity of South Carolina. His Ph.D. is in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Chicago (1976). He was from 2000 to 2009 the department chair at USC, and in 2005-2006 was interim dean. He has done research in document retrieval, computational number theory, and parallel computing, and has more recently turned to digital humanities as one of the emerging “marketplace” applications for computing. He is engaged with First Year English at USC on the analysis of freshman English essays, searching for an understanding of actual student writing in an effort to improve pedagogy for first year English instruction. He has team taught four times with Dr. Heidi Rae Cooley on the presentation of unacknowledged history on mobile devices, and he and Dr. Cooley are actively engaged in ways to go beyond text to fully enable the use of visual media in mobile applications that present humanities content, especially content that might normally remain unacknowledged by institutional authority.<br><br></li> </ul>

<li><strong>September 8, 2017 - Security Challenges for the Internet of Things: A Semantics-Based View</strong><br>
<ul><li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Csilla Farkas, University of South Carolina<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Are you living in a smart home?  Are you using smart devices to monitor your health?  Is your organization considering to increase automation for sensing and controlling operations?  While the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) may mean different things to different people, there is a common theme:  the need for cybersecurity.  The key security challenges are focused on three areas: 1) device vulnerabilities, 2) communication security and trust, and 3) data integrity, security, and privacy.  In this talk I present a semantics-based approach to support IoT data integration and security.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>September 15, 2017 - Human attribute recognition by refining attention heat map </strong><br>
<ul><li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Song Wang, University of South Carolina<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Most existing methods of human attribute recognition are part-based and the performance of these methods is highly dependent on the accuracy of body-part detection, which is a well known challenging problem in computer vision. In this talk, I will introduce a new method to recognize human attributes by using CAM (Class Activation Map) network, as well as an unsupervised algorithm to refine the attention heat map, which is an intermediate result in CAM and reflects relevant image regions for each attribute. The proposed method does not require the detection of body parts and the prior correspondence between body parts and attributes. The proposed methods can achieve comparable performance of attribute recognition to the current state-of-the-art methods. <br><br></li>

<li><strong>September 22, 2017 - Generating Effective Test Suites by Combining Coverage Criteria</strong><br>
<ul><li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Gregory Gay, University of South Carolina<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong>  A number of criteria have been proposed to judge test suite adequacy.  While search-based test generation has improved greatly at criteria coverage, the produced suites are still often ineffective at detecting faults. Efficacy may be limited by the single-minded application of one criterion at a time when generating suites - a sharp contrast to human testers, who simultaneously explore multiple testing strategies. We hypothesize that automated generation can be improved by selecting and simultaneously exploring multiple criteria. To address this hypothesis, we have generated multi-criteria test suites, measuring efficacy against the Defects4J fault database. We have found that multi-criteria suites can be up to 31.15% more effective at detecting complex, real-world faults than suites generated to satisfy a single criterion and 70.17% more effective than the default combination of all eight criteria.  Given a fixed search budget, we recommend pairing a criterion focused on structural exploration - such as Branch Coverage - with targeted supplemental strategies aimed at the type of faults expected from the system under test. Our findings offer lessons to consider when selecting such combinations.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>September 29, 2017 - Error Correction Mechanisms in Social Networks: Implications for Replicators</strong><br>
<ul><li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Matthew Brashears, University of South Carolina (Sociology)<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Humans make mistakes but diffusion through social networks is typically modeled as though they do not. We find in an experiment that efforts to correct mistakes are effective, but generate more mutant forms of the contagion than would result from a lack of correction. This indicates that the ability of messages to cross “small-world” human social networks may be overestimated and that failed error corrections create new versions of a contagion that diffuse in competition with the original. These results are extended to a nascent general theory of replicators explaining how error correction mechanisms facilitate rapid saturation of a search space. A simulation model and preliminary results are presented that are consistent with this prediction.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>October 6, 2017 - Enhancement of Hi-C experimental data using deep convolutional neural network</strong><br>
<ul><li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Jijun Tang, University of South Carolina<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hi-C technology is one of the most popular tools for measuring the spatial organization of mammalian genomes. Although an increasing number of Hi-C datasets have been generated in a variety of tissue/cell types, due to high sequencing cost, the resolution of most Hi-C datasets are coarse and cannot be used to infer enhancer-promoter interactions or link disease-related non-coding variants to their target genes. To address this challenge, we develop HiCPlus, a computational approach based on deep convolutional neural network, to infer high-resolution Hi-C interaction matrices from low-resolution Hi-C data. Through extensive testing, we demonstrate that HiCPlus can impute interaction matrices highly similar to the original ones, while using only as few as 1/16 of the total sequencing reads. We observe that Hi-C interaction matrix contains unique local features that are consistent across different cell types, and such features can be effectively captured by the deep learning framework. We further apply HiCPlus to enhance and expand the usability of Hi-C data sets in a variety of tissue and cell types. In summary, our work not only provides a framework to generate high-resolution Hi-C matrix with a fraction of the sequencing cost, but also reveals features underlying the formation of 3D chromatin interactions.

<li><strong>October 13, 2017 - Toward a Theory of Automated Design of Minimal Robots</strong><br>
<ul><li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Jason O'Kane, University of South Carolina<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong>The design of an effective autonomous robot relies upon a complex web of interactions and tradeoffs between various hardware and software components.  The problem of designing such a robot becomes even more challenging when the objective is to find robot designs that are minimal, in the sense of utilizing only limited sensing, actuation, or computational resources.  The usual approach to navigating these tradeoffs is currently by careful analysis and human cleverness.  In contrast, this talk will present some recent research that seeks to automate some parts of this process, by representing models for a robot's interaction with the world as formal, algorithmically-manipulable objects, and posing various kinds of questions on those data structures.  The results include both both bad news (i.e., hardness results) and good news (practical algorithms). <br><br></li>
<li><strong>Bio:</strong> Jason O'Kane is Associate Professor in Computer Science and Engineering and Director of the Center for Computational Robotics at the University of South Carolina.  He holds the Ph.D. (2007) and M.S. (2005) degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the B.S. (2001) degree from Taylor University, all in Computer Science.  He has won a CAREER Award from NSF, a Breakthrough Star Award from the University of South Carolina, and the Outstanding Graduate in Computer Science Award from Taylor University.  He was a member of the DARPA Computer Science Study Group.  His research spans algorithmic robotics, planning under uncertainty, and computational geometry.<br><br></li> </ul>

<li><strong>October 27, 2017 - Portable Parallel Programming in the Age of Architecture Diversity for High Performance</strong><br>
<ul><li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Yonghong Yan, University of South Carolina<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Today’s computer systems are becoming much more heterogeneous and complex from both computer architecture and memory system. High performance computing systems and large-scale enterprise clusters are often built with the combination of multiple architectures including multicore CPUs, Nvidia manycore GPUs, Intel Xeon Phi vector manycores, and domain-specific processing units, such as DSP and deep-learning tensor units. The introduction of non-volatile memory and 3D-stack DRAM known as high-bandwidth memory further complicated computer systems by significantly increasing the complexity of the memory hierarchy. For users, parallel programming for those systems has thus become much more challenging than ever. In this talk, the speaker will highlight the latest development of parallel programming models for the existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing. He will introduce the ongoing work in his research team (http://passlab.github.io) for improving productivity and portability of parallel programming for heterogeneous systems with the combination of shared and discrete memory. The speaker will conclude that this is an exciting time for performing computer system research and also share some of his unsuccessful experiences for studying his Ph.D.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Bio:</strong> Dr. Yonghong Yan joined University of South Carolina as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2017 and he is a member of OpenMP Architectural Review Board and OpenMP Language Committee. Dr. Yan calls himself a nerd for parallel computing, compiler technology and high-performance computer architecture and systems. He is an NSF CAREER awardee. His research team develop intra-/inter-node programming models, compiler, runtime systems and performance tools based on OpenMP, MPI and LLVM compiler, explore conventional and advanced computer architectures including CPU, vector, GPU, MIC, FPGA, and dataflow system, and support applications ranging from classical HPC, to big data analysis and machine learning, and to computer imaging. The ongoing development can be found from https://github.com/passlab. Dr. Yan received his PhD degree in computer science from University of Houston and has a bachelor degree in mechanical engineering<br><br></li> </ul>

<li><strong>December 1, 2017 - Deep Learning and its Application in Bioinformatics: Case Study on Protein-peptide Binding Prediction
</strong><br>
<ul><li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Jianjun Hu, University of South Carolina<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep learning has led to tremendous progress in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. It has now crossed the boundary and has brought breakthroughs also in the area of bioinformatics. One interesting problem is developing accurate models for predicting peptide binding affinities to protein receptors such as MHC(Major Histocompatibility complex), which can shed understanding to adverse drug reaction and autoimmune diseases and lead to more effective protein therapy and design of vaccines.<br><br>

We proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based peptide binding prediction algorithm for achieving substantially higher accuracy as tested in MHC-I peptide binding affinity prediction. Our model takes raw binding peptide sequences and affinity scores or binding labels as input without needing any human-designed features. The back-propagation training algorithm allows it to learn nonlinear relationships among the amino acid positions of the peptides. It also can naturally handle the peptide length variation, MHC polymorphasim, and unbalanced training samples of MHC proteins with different alleles via a simple amino acid padding scheme. Our experiments showed that DeepMHC can achieve the state-of-the-art prediction performance on most of the IEDB benchmark datasets with a single model architecture and without using any consensus or composite ensemble classifier models. <br><br></li>
<li><strong>Bio:</strong> I joined CSE department of the University of South Carolina in August 2007.
