Notes on data files:

These files are in the JSON format. To read them into GRADS, it is easiest to use Google's GSON library, which can be downloaded from here: http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/

For example, to deserialize (read text into object model):
 
List<StudentRecord> studentRecords = new Gson().fromJson( new FileReader( new File("students.txt")), new TypeToken<List<StudentRecord>>(){}.getType());

and then to serialize (write object model back to text):

List<StudentRecord> students = ...
String representation = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create().toJson(students);
(you can then use your preferred Java file writing method, or manipulate the string)

----------------------

For the project, you will need to read in:
students.txt (student records)
courses.txt (courses offered by the department)
users.txt (user permissions)

progress.txt is an example of a partial progress summary written back to a file. You don't need to read it into your system. It is just included as an example. 

You WILL need to add examples. We have given you a basic sample, but it is insufficient to reflect the different plans and corner cases of this system. Ask us if you have any questions.
